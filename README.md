# Windows Setup
## What is this?

This is simple batch script that I run after install windows. It's to install
chocolatey, my most used programs and modify the registry (slightly). Intended
to be run on Windows 7 or Windows 10. If you terminate the script, the prompt
will not revert. To revert, run `set PROMPT=$p$g`.
